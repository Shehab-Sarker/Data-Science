# Touple
#  1. A tuple is a collection of ordered, immutable (unchangeable), and heterogeneous
#  (different data types) elements.
#  2. Tuples are faster than lists because they are immutable.
#  3. Tuples are defined using parentheses ().
# Tuples in Python are immutable, which means you can't change, add, or remove items once the tuple is created. Because of this,
#  tuple methods are very limited compared to lists.
